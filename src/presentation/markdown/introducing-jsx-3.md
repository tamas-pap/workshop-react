# Create a new app from scratch 3

We will create a new app with the `create-react-app` command line tool.
Let's start with installing it.

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Now we can create a new application with it. In your terminal navigate to the folder where you want to create the project and run:

```
create-react-app yourProjectName
```

Once finished, navigate to the project folder and run `npm start`. Your application is now running on `http://localhost:3000`.
