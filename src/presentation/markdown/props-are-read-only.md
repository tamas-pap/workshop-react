# Props are Read-Only

When you declare a component it must never modify its own props. Consider this `sum` function:

```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Such functions are called ["pure"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

```js
function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}
```

React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:
