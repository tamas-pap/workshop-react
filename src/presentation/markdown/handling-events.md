# Handling events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntactic differences:

>
> React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
>
> With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

For example, the HTML:

```html
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

is slightly different in React:

```html
<button onClick={activateLasers}>Activate Lasers</button>
```

## Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

Inside a loop it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if `id` is the row ID, either of the following would work:

```js
<button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button>
```

The above two lines are equivalent, and use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and [`Function.prototype.bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) respectively.

In both cases, the `e` argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with `bind` any further arguments are automatically forwarded.
