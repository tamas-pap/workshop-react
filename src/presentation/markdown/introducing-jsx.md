# Introducing JSX

Consider this variable declaration:

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.

It is called `JSX`, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript.

`JSX` may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
