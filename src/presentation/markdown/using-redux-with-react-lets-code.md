# Let's code

Implement the `EmailList` component with `React` and `Redux`.

It should display a list of emails, each of them having option to  `archiveEmail` and `deleteEmail`.

**No need** to implement the `addEmail` method this time. You can work with the following list of emails:

```js
[
  { id: 1, from: 'John Jones', to: 'Amy Aniston', subject: 'Hello to Amy', body: 'Hi! This is Amy. How are you?' },
  { id: 2, from: 'John Jones', to: 'Bernadett Benetton', subject: 'Hello to Bernadett', body: 'Hi! This is Bernadett. How are you?' },
  { id: 3, from: 'John Jones', to: 'Carol Crowford', subject: 'Hello to Carol', body: 'Hi! This is Carol. How are you?' },
  { id: 4, from: 'John Jones', to: 'Diana Dacy', subject: 'Hello to Diana', body: 'Hi! This is Diana. How are you?' },
  { id: 5, from: 'John Jones', to: 'Emily Edwards', subject: 'Hello to Emily', body: 'Hi! This is Emily. How are you?' },
];
```
